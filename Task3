Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

Solution:

func replaceMatches(for pattern: String, inString string: String, withString replacementString: String) -> String? {
  guard let regex = try? NSRegularExpression(pattern: pattern, options: []) else {
    return string
  }
  
  let range = NSRange(string.startIndex..., in: string)
  return regex.stringByReplacingMatches(in: string, options: [], range: range, withTemplate: replacementString)
}
